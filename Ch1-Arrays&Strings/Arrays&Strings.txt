Hash Table

a hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values for highly efficient lookups

Linked List Implementation

1) compute key values hash code

2) map the hash code into index of array using hash(key) % array length

3) at that index there is a linked list of keys and values. Linked list is used
in the case of a collision


Arrays and Resizable lists
- in some languages arrays are automatically Resizable, the array or list will grow
as items are appended on. Other languages like java are a fixe length

- an ArrayList in java automatically offers dynamic resizing when the array is full double in size

Array Declarations
c/c++: int name [10] = {};

java: int [] name; or int name[]; ArrayList<String> sentence = new ArrayList<String>();

python: variable = [] #this creates a list really but its resizable
